# Model Registry

Every model forge knows about, classified by eval-suite status.

## Status meanings

- **Current** — in the v0.7.0 eval suite. Numbers in [`docs/results/`](results/) and the [dashboard](results/dashboard.html).
- **Retired** — appeared in a prior eval suite, cut from the current one. Either too weak (bare scores below the threshold for informative comparison) or superseded by a newer family member. Sampling defaults retained for backward compatibility.
- **Unpublished** — sampling defaults are present (either dogfooded by forge consumers, or staged for a future eval), but no eval numbers have been published. Forge will work with them; performance is undocumented.

Sampling values are sourced from the model's HuggingFace card unless noted. Values are verified one model at a time — see [`src/forge/clients/sampling_defaults.py`](../src/forge/clients/sampling_defaults.py) for the authoritative map.

¹ Ministral-3 Instruct cards say "temperature below 0.1 for production"; 0.05 picked within that range.
² Ministral-3 Reasoning cards show `top_p=0.95` in code examples but do NOT include it in the formal "Recommended Settings" section. Add explicitly if you want to follow the examples.
³ Granite 4.1 sampling mirrors the Granite 4.0 IBM convention (greedy decoding); marked unconfirmed pending IBM publication for the 4.1 family specifically.
⁴ Phi-4: no formal sampling recommendation from any official source (Microsoft HF card, model docs). Falls through to backend defaults.
⁵ **Claude numbers in v0.7.0 docs are from the v0.6.0 dataset.** The Anthropic ablation was not re-run in v0.7.0 due to cost (~$272 for the full 11,700-row matrix). Backend support is unchanged; numbers are stable to within tool-error-channel sensitivity (small).

³ Granite 4.0 sampling is greedy decoding (T=0); `top_p=1.0` and `top_k=0` are mathematical no-ops at T=0 but kept explicit to match the source recommendation.

## Unpublished

Sampling params staged, no eval data published. Forge supports these — performance is undocumented.

⁶ Qwen3.5-122B-A10B: smoke probe starts with `--reasoning-budget 0` (instruct mode). Bumping to thinking mode is a separate run if smoke clean. Card lists a "balanced" preset of T=0.7 / top_p=0.8 / top_k=20.
⁷ Mistral-Small-4 card gives T=0.7 for `reasoning_effort="high"` and "between 0.0 and 0.7" for `reasoning_effort="none"` (task-dependent). High-effort profile picked as the safer default; top_p/top_k not specified on the card.
⁸ Nemotron-3 Super: card recommends T=1.0 / top_p=0.95 across all tasks. `low_effort` reins in over-thinking; `force_nonempty_content` so the model emits something substantive instead of empty `<think>` blocks.
⁹ Nemotron-3 Nano: card splits sampling into "Reasoning" (T=1.0, top_p=1.0) and "Tool-calling" (T=0.6, top_p=0.95) presets. Currently using the tool-calling preset to test whether F3 deception observed at higher T is temperature-tunable.
¹⁰ gpt-oss-120b: per the llama.cpp maintainer guide, **explicitly do not set `repeat_penalty` or `presence_penalty`** — they degrade output. Registry omission == None == field omitted from request body. `reasoning_effort` adjustable via `chat_template_kwargs`; "medium" is the current default, bring down if overthinking observed.

## Identity keys

Each model is keyed in `sampling_defaults.py` under all the identity forms a caller might use:
- Ollama-style strings (e.g. `qwen3:8b-q8_0`) — for `OllamaClient`
- GGUF file stems (e.g. `Qwen3-8B-Q8_0`) — for `LlamafileClient` with a `.gguf`
- Llamafile binary stems (e.g. `Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407.Q4_K_M`) — for `LlamafileClient` with a `.llamafile`

All forms point at independent rows starting as copies of the same HF card values, so vendor-specific guidance (e.g. an Ollama modelfile that diverges from the HF card) can be encoded without forcing alignment.

## Models intentionally absent from sampling defaults

Two models in the Retired tier have **no entry** in the sampling map at all:

- **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** — Meta's HF card, llama.com/docs, and llama-recipes are all silent on sampling
- **Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3** — HF card has no "recommended settings" section; code examples use `temperature=0.0` (greedy) but explicitly note it's demo-only

These fall through to backend defaults. **Phi-4 (Current)** is in the same category — no formal recommendation — but kept in the Current tier because it's in the v0.7.0 eval and supported as a viable model.
